Here is a text analysis project I completed for my machine learning course. The problem it solves is sentiment analysis for an E-commerce company's online website shopping reviews. It does this by creating several different machine learning models to fit and test out. The dataset the problem works with can be found here. https://www.kaggle.com/nicapotato/womens-ecommerce-clothing-reviews
